- [ ] Create large scale data processing script for droid 
    - [ ] Do not use the low callibrated cameras for now
- [ ] Why do so many downloads fail?
- [ ] FIX time alignment.. Save how often it happens..
- [ ] Train a model to recoginize the gripper and contact flow first
- [ ] Get mask only for Gripper
- [ ] Filter the bad camera

- [ ] Save only depth (more efficienty) and directly use the provided mp4



Training:
- [ ] Select object to start with
- [ ] Start with language annotations and maybe even object segementation



Later:


- [ ] Calibrate the wrist camera z direction with ICP  -> postponed!
- [ ] Do not use the wrist camera for depth improvement for now -> postponed
- [ ] Wrist cam relies on gripper -> fir the grippr in the external cameras and with the robot urdf and then fit the wrist cam based on the gripper and test if the other depths aligm mooe or less afterward (which is better the locaiton of the ee or the wrist cam) -> but wrist cam relies on gripper so gripper should be more accurate
- [ ] Make sure everything within a radios of xy is absolutley static
- [ ] Where the depth does not change, there it should have "static" points (until it becomes close to the gripper at least) -> keep static if no extreme changes otherwise..
- [ ] Use sensor depth for not, and the reprojections later -> using reprojection postponed
- [ ] Align gripper and wrist camera and CtRNet-X callibration for optimal alignment
- [ ] Fuse point cloud and improve with cleaning and plane-to-plane ICP


- [ ] Track with SpaTrackV2 and MVTracker the object in 3D

- [ ] Create 3D object model on the fly wiht Sam3D and track the intersection between the object and the gripper w/o trackingconvention
